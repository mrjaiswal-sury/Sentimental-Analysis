# Sentimental-Analysis
 A Machine learning model made by using Support vector classifier(SVM) and count vectorizer, Naive Bayes Classification and Random Forest Classification to predict the label of the Restaurant review either positive or negative.
 The model was later then created and saved using Pickle
 
 The accuracies of each classification method is compared and a classification report is prepared.
 I tried to make it as user interactive as possible by implementing graphs and animations
